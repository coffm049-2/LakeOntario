Run FVCOM until March 1st, have a restart dump with metadata from that date:
```
/expanse/lustre/projects/ncs124/llowe/HYDRO/run/restart/leem_restart_0001.nc
```

Run FVCOM one timestep, have a restart dump on that first timestep.  This is to get the TP initial conditions from the DETRITUS file into netCDF format.
```
/expanse/lustre/projects/ncs124/llowe/HYDRO/run/output/leem_restart_0001.nc
```

Copy somewheres safe:
```
cd
mkdir leem_restart
cd leem_restart
cp /expanse/lustre/projects/ncs124/llowe/HYDRO/run/restart/leem_restart_0001.nc ./leem_restart_march1.nc
cp /expanse/lustre/projects/ncs124/llowe/HYDRO/run/output/leem_restart_0001.nc ./leem_restart_jan1.nc
```

Replace TP values in March 1st with that of first timestep

ncks -A -v TP leem_restart_init.nc leem_restart_march1.nc
